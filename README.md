For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Foundations course), I needed to create a web page from scratch based on a design that was supplied to me (making use of the knowledge I had gained about CSS and Flexbox). The design can be viewed in the folder above, and you can view the web page via the following link: https://rednaxelam.github.io/landing-page/

The web page works fairly well when using a modern version of google chrome or firefox on my 22â€³ 1920x1080 desktop monitor, and hopefully it will work OK for other web browsers and for desktop monitors of other sizes and resolutions (I haven't covered responsive web page design yet).

Try zooming in and zooming out to see what happens!
